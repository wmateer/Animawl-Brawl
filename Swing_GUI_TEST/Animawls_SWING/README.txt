Starting a game.
Implemented so far:
1)Click passed the title screen
2)Create a new user with the register button
3)Login
4)Select Multiplayer
5)Select Create duel
6)Choose 3 animals for your team
7)Game screen will initialize your name, animal, and picture on the left side
Comments: player 2 is hard coded in. Saving animal and player data has not been implemented,
only the first attack is implemented so far for the bear. So if you want to test it, select 3 bears.
HP/AP bar are a work in progress like most of the this project.


How to build file
find the source directory in terminal
this directory should have the build.xml file in it.
from here, type "ant clean"
this will clean the files of the .class files
next type "ant run"
this will do "ant run" plus "ant compile"
from here the window will pop up and you will be able to playtest the game.
